# Developer Roadmap - Basic Stack

SW Sapein les comparte un** Developer Roadmap** (Hoja de ruta de desarrollador) para que cualquier desarrollador que quiera adentrarse a temas de facturaci칩n electr칩nica tenga una pila b치sica de informaci칩n, lecciones, ejemplos, c칩digos, tecnolog칤as, arquitecturas, entre otras herramientas para as칤 desarrollar soluciones mantenibles y escalables.

Nuestro Developer Roadmap contiene 10 temas especificos que le ayudar치n a tener una pila b치sica de habilidades para un desarrollador.

Muchas gracias  a nuestros autores **Heltton Ramirez** y **Octavio Hernandez**.

Agradecimientos especiales a nuestro equipo de **SW Sapien** y a nuestros revisores **.....**.

## Biograf칤a de nuestros autores

....

**Lorem Ipsum** is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

**There are many variations** of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.

## Requerimientos necesarios

We have two choices of IoT hardware to use for the projects depending on personal preference, programming language knowledge or preferences, learning goals and availability. We have also provided a 'virtual hardware' version for those who don't have access to hardware, or want to learn more before committing to a purchase. You can read more and find a 'shopping list' on the [hardware page](./hardware.md), including links to buy complete kits from our friends at Seeed Studio.
